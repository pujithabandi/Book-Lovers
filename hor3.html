            <h3>The Third-Floor Tenant</h3>
The Third-Floor Tenant


Elena moved into the old apartment building, seeking solitude. The rent was cheap, and the location was convenient.


But strange noises echoed from the third floor:


- Footsteps at midnight
- Whispers in the vents
- Doors creaking open


Elena dismissed it as the building's age.


One evening, she encountered a girl on the third floor:


- Pale skin
- Sunken eyes
- Tattered dress


The girl vanished into thin air.


Elena researched the building's history:


- A family tragedy occurred on the third floor
- A young girl died under mysterious circumstances


As encounters escalated:


- Elena found cryptic messages on her door
- The girl's presence grew stronger


Desperate for answers, Elena investigated the third floor:


- A hidden room revealed the girl's name: Lucy
- A series of disturbing Polaroids


Elena discovered Lucy's dark past:


- Abused and neglected
- Died under her father's care


Lucy's spirit sought justice.


Elena confronted the building's owner, Mr. Jenkins:


- He was Lucy's father
- Guilt and greed kept him silent


As Elena exposed the truth:


- Lucy's presence intensified
- Jenkins' sanity unraveled


In a chilling climax:


- Elena and Jenkins faced Lucy's vengeful spirit
- Trapped in the hidden room


Elena escaped, but Jenkins remained:


- Trapped with Lucy's ghost
- Forever tortured by his past


Elena moved out, but whispers persisted:


- The third floor remained haunted
- Lucy's presence still lingered
